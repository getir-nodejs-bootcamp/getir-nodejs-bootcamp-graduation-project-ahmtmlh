# Getir Node.js Bootcamp Graduation Project
## The Challenge
We’d like you to create a RESTful API with a single endpoint that fetches the data in the provided MongoDB collection and return the results in the requested format.
Requirements
- The code should be written in Node.js using express framework
- The endpoint should just handle HTTP POST requests.
- The application should be deployed on AWS or Heroku. You don’t need to use any API Gateway, Load Balancers or any other layer than the developed application.
- The up to date repo should be publicly available in Github, Bitbucket or equivalent.

## Deliverables
- The public repo URL which has the source code of the project, and a set of instructions if there is any project specific configurations needed to run the project.
- The public endpoint URL of the deployed API which is available for testing.

## Deploy
The application is deployed at: https://getir-bootcamp-ahmtmlh.herokuapp.com/
